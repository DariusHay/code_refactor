This Assignment was a refactoring assaignment where I made the HTML more 
accessible to anyone that will access this file in the future.
I added better semantic elements to better organize the coding.
This is a link to the page, http://127.0.0.1:5500/Develop/index.html#social-media-marketing 
I added alt attributes to images, and added comments to the css file and renamed selector elements to better organize the page.
